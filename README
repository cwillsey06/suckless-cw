suckless-cw
===========
a collection of my patched & configured suckless software
also includes some extras, like wallpapers for dwm & etc.


Compilation
-----------
First, clone this repository:
$ git clone --recurse-submodules \
  	https://github.com/cwillsey06/suckless-cw.git

Then, build all the included software:
$ find $(pwd -P) -maxdepth 1 -not -path '*/.git' -type d \
  	-exec sh -c 'cd {} && make' ';'


Then you can choose what to do with the binaries.
Personally, I sym-link them into my ~/.local/bin/:
$ find $(pwd -P) -maxdepth 2 -type f -executable \
  	-exec ln -sf {} $HOME/.local/bin ';'
